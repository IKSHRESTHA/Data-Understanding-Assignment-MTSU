    "# HW03- Simple Regression with Real Estate Data\n",

    "## Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a stastistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable and are most commonly used. \n",
    "Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $y$ is the dependent variable (response variable)\n",
    "- $x$ is the independent variable (predictor variable)\n",
    "- $\\beta_0$ is the y-intercept of the regression line\n",
    "- $\\beta_1$ is the slope of the regression line\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$ is the error term (residuals)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several assumptions that need to be met for simple linear regression to be valid:\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variable is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence**: The observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals (errors) have constant variance across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
    "4. **Normality**: The residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these assumptions are not met, the results of the regression analysis may be invalid or misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to check these assumptions, we can use various diagnostic plots and statistical tests.\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: We can use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "2. **Independence**: We can check the independence of observations by examining the data collection process and ensuring that there is no autocorrelation.  \n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: We can use residual plots to check for constant variance of the residuals.\n",
    "4. **Normality**: We can use Q-Q plots or statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test to check if the residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If assumptions are violated, we may need to consider alternative regression methods or transformations of the data.If assumptions are met, then we will focuse on the accuracy of the model, which can be evaluated using various metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and root mean squared error (RMSE).\n",
    "1. **R-squared**: This metric indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.\n",
    "2. **Adjusted R-squared**: This metric adjusts the R-squared value for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate measure of model fit when multiple independent variables are used.\n",
    "3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: This metric measures the average magnitude of the residuals, providing an indication of how well the model predicts the dependent variable. Lower RMSE values indicate a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "while r-squared and adjusted r-squared are useful for evaluating the overall fit of the model, RMSE is particularly useful for assessing the accuracy of predictions made by the model. It is always not necessary that having a high R-squared value means that the model is accurate, as it may be overfitting the data. That is why RMSE is a more reliable metric for evaluating the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "For this assignment, we will be more focused on the building a simple linear regression model using the real estate data and evaluating its performance using the metrics mentioned above."
